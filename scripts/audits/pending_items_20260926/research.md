Agent-verified, not clinician-reviewed. Thresholds, severities and categories were not changed.

## IQM cascara_sagrada: RxNorm anchor
- RxNav `rxcui/66869/properties`: name "cascara sagrada", synonym "cascara", tty IN; allProperties:
  ATC A06AB07, SNOMEDCT 23888001, DrugBank DB15478.
- RxNav `rxcui/1350209/properties`: "Frangula purshiana bark extract", synonym "Cascara sagrada bark
  extract", tty IN. `rxcui.json?name=cascara sagrada` -> 66869.
- The entry said "No RxNorm concept found via GSRS lookup". RxNorm has the ingredient concept 66869.

## RULE_IQM_CHONDROITIN: INR figures and dose-floor attribution
- PMID 18363538 (Knudsen JF, Sokol GH. Pharmacotherapy 2008;28(4):540-8), abstract: on glucosamine
  500 mg / chondroitin 400 mg twice a day the INR held at 2.5-3.2; after increasing to glucosamine
  1500 mg and chondroitin 1200 mg twice/day "his INR previous to this change was 2.3. Approximately
  3 weeks later, his INR increased to 3.9."
- PMID 14986566 (Rozenfeld V et al. Am J Health Syst Pharm 2004;61(3):306-7) is a letter with no
  PubMed abstract; the publisher page returned a bot check, so its figures could not be read.
- The anticoagulant copy said "INR increase from 2.6 to 4.1", a figure neither readable source states.
  Two dose-floor rationales credited PMID 14986566 with "1200 mg BID", which is Knudsen's figure.
- Not changed (clinical threshold, for Sean): the floor is 1200 mg per day while the source escalated
  to 1200 mg twice a day (2400 mg per day).

## RULE_IQM_BLACK_SEED_OIL_DIABETES: dose-floor rationale
- PMID 27512971 (Sahebkar A et al. J Hypertens 2016;34(11):2127-35): meta-analysis of 11 RCTs
  (860 people) on blood pressure only; SBP -3.26 mmHg, DBP -2.80 mmHg; "No association was observed
  between SBP lowering and time on treatment, N. sativa dosage or type of N. sativa."
- The rationale said the meta-analysis shows "(and glucose/lipids)" lowering. It reports neither.
- Not changed (for Sean): the "~2 g oil / 1.5 g powder per day" basis is not in the abstract, and the
  abstract reports no dose association.

## RULE_INGREDIENT_EVENING_PRIMROSE_OIL: dose-floor rationale
- PMID 19783511 (Riaz A, Khan RA, Ahmed SP. Pak J Pharm Sci 2009;22(4):355-9): healthy rabbits given
  90, 180 or 360 microlitres/kg for 30 and 60 days; all coagulation assays except fibrinogen time
  increased and platelet count fell.
- The rationale said the study shows increased bleeding time "at supplemental GLA doses (~300 mg GLA ~
  3 g oil)". It reports no human dose and no bleeding time. The 3 g oil floor is the clinical-team
  threshold recorded on the rule's dose_thresholds note (sign-off 2026-04-24).

## IQM miroestrol: structural class
- PubChem CID 165001 Miroestrol: C20H22O6, IUPAC
  (1S,3R,13S,16R,17R,18S)-7,13,16,17-tetrahydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-10-oxapentacyclo[14.2.1.03,12.04,9.013,18]nonadeca-4(9),5,7,11-tetraen-14-one.
- PubChem "coumestan": CID 638309, C15H8O3, [1]benzofuro[3,2-c]chromen-6-one. Miroestrol does not
  have the coumestan skeleton, so "coumestan constituent" was wrong.
- GSRS `substances/search?q=miroestrol`: 0 results. The entry's gsrs block is hand-authored (for Sean).

## DSI_WAR_GARLIC: wrong-topic citation
- PMID 10594976 (Ankri S, Mirelman D. Microbes Infect 1999): "Antimicrobial properties of allicin
  from garlic." Right ingredient, wrong topic for a warfarin bleeding interaction.
- NCCIH garlic page (https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/garlic, read 2026-09-26): "Taking garlic
  supplements may increase the risk of bleeding ... medicines, such as anticoagulants or aspirin".
  That source stays and supports the pair.
- Not changed (uncertain): the mechanism's "Some evidence of mild CYP2C9 inhibition" has no cited source.

## DEP_BETABLOCKERS_COQ10: source label
- PMID 12392188 (Cocco T et al. J Bioenerg Biomembr 2002 Aug): "The antihypertensive drug carvedilol
  inhibits the activity of mitochondrial NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase."
- The source label named a different paper (Folkers K, lovastatin, PNAS 1990) while its URL pointed to
  12392188. The record is already suppressed (citation_review_status needs_revision).
